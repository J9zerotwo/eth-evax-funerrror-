## Daily Load Transaction

This Solidity program simulates a simple transaction system where users can load funds into their accounts, transfer funds to others, and withdraw all their funds. It demonstrates basic Solidity features, including `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements for validation, making it a great learning tool for newcomers to Solidity smart contract development.

### Description

This contract is written in Solidity, a language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to:
- Load funds into their account.
- Transfer funds to other users.
- Withdraw all funds from their account.

Using this contract, developers can learn to work with mappings to store balances, define custom events, and implement error handling for common scenarios.
